        <h1>Cupcake Website - Home Page</h1>
        <p>For the home page mockup, there are several features that I wanted to make sure to include. I created a 2000 x 1800 px file in Gimp. The first feature I wanted to include was a clear header with links to the most popular pages on the website. I also wanted a logo for the website so I created one in Photoshop using a .png image of a cupcake. 

          I downloaded an original font, Coolvectica, to match the style of my website and I chose a color scheme - teal, purple, and pink because I wanted bright, fun colors for my cupcake theme. I also wanted to include a footer with a sitemap, to reach the rest of the website pages.
          
          I also divided the home page into three key sections for a site visitor to be able to browse “featured” and “seasonal” sections.</p>

<section id="mockup2">
  <div class="image-box">
      <h1>Cupcake Website - About Page</h1>
      <p>For the about page, I made sure to underline the “About” in the header to highlight that that’s where the site visitor is. I created two color blocked sections to clearly distinguish them. I overlapped photos and color boxes to create a cool, eye-appealing effect. I made sure to use the same colors from the whole website’s color scheme to keep it consistent.</p>

<section id="mockup3">
  <div class="image-box">
      <h1>Cupcake Website - Menu Page</h1>
      <p>For the menu page, I wanted to highlight classic flavours, featured flavours, and other flavours. I used the same color scheme as the other two pages. I layered a pink colored square behind each cupcake image to create depth. Each cupcake photo is 285 x 285 pixels so it’s big enough to see the high quality image but small enough that I could add in more information on the page.</p>
