            <h2>Image 1 - Eiffel Tower</h2>
            <p>This is an image of the Eiffel Tower, which I edited in Gimp. I wanted to change the sky background of the image and to make the image more bright and vivid. First, I used the Fuzzy Select Tool to highlight the sky on the original photo. I clicked remove and then using the Erase tool went in to erase the parts of the sky that weren't automatically removed. I had to zoom in to 300% to be able to remove some parts of the sky in detail. After that, I found a high quality image of a sky with clouds in it and uploaded it as a layer to the image. I placed the layer behind the Eiffel Tower image so that the sky neatly fit behind the tower. To improve the brightness of the photo, I went into the Colors/Brightness-Contrast settings to increase both the brightness and contrast of the tower against the sky. I exported the image as a high resolution .png image so that it would be optimised for the web.  </p>

          <h2>Image 2 - Sunflower</h2>
          <p>For this photo, I thought it would be fun to put a baby photo inside the sunflower. I found a photo of Princess Charlotte and I used the Ellipse Select Tool in Gimp to crop a circular image of her face. I cropped it and pasted it over the photo of the sunflower. I had to adjust the layer size until it fit into the sunflower. I exported the image as a .jpg file.</p>

        <h2>Image 3 - Family Photo</h2>
        <p>I found a modern family photo but I wanted to make it look like an old black and white photo. I first added a sepia filter and adjusted the black and white contrast. I then added a blurred border for a special effect. I also used the Blur button in Gimp to make the photo look a bit more outdated. </p>

      <h2>Image 4 - Ariana's Cakes Logo</h2>
      <p>I wanted to create an original logo for a cake shop so I started off by finding this circle logo image. In Gimp, I created a transparent layer and merged the logo on top of the transparent layer. I used the Fuzzy Select Tool to remove the white center in the middle of the circle and outside of it. I then locked down the layer so I could use the paintbrush to paint it pink. I downloaded a new font, Coolvetica, and imported it into Gimp for the logo name. Then I found a cake image and imported it as a layer into the logo, after also painting it pink.</p>

      <h2>Image 5 - The Beach </h2>
      <p>I decided to replace the sand in a beach photo with a grassy lawn. I created a transparent layer and merged the beach photo with it. Then, using the Fuzzy Select Tool, I removed the sand. I used the Erase tool to clean up the parts that the select tool didn’t pick up. I uploaded the lawn photo to a new layer and layered it behind the beach photo so that it would show up in the transparent section.</p>

      <h2>Image 6 - Birkbeck Logo</h2>
      <p>Finally, I decided to give the Birkbeck University logo an update.  First, I changed the background color using the Paint Bucket tool. I used the Paint Bucket and Paintbrush to change the color of the Coat of Arms. I uploaded a few icons into Gimp, including a heart, a pencil, and a sun. I gave them all transparent backgrounds and then placed them on the image to change the Coat of Arms and the “I” in Birkbeck.</p>
